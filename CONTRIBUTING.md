# Contributing

All contributions are welcome to the project, the curators try to review all PRs as quickly as possible. Yet, this is a volunteer run project, so please be patient with it. If you are planning on submitting bigger changes to the projects, please open a github issue first and talk to the team before submitting to make sure your work will be accepted. Please refer to the  [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) document for details.

The curators might reject any contribution without stating a reason, but especially if the contribution or contributor in question is not following the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) or doesn't follow the right procedure outlined below.

## Submitting a package

If a package isn't listed on the website yet, feel free to send us a pull-request for it. Please make sure the pull request contains the following:

 - the data for your package (see the [DOCS] on how to do that)
 - adds the package to the appropriate topic(s)


If you are in a hurry and don't have the time to prepare the PR, you can also submit an issue requesting for the package to be added. *Make sure you mark the issue with the `please-add`-tag*.

And add a few words to the PR (or issue) about the package and why it should be listed (e.g. novel approach, popularity, first of its kind...). The more info we have (and the less work it is), the more likely it will be added soon.

## Complaining about incorrect text

Please open a github issue if you feel that anything is represented or out of date. Keep in mind that the description of a package is directly pulled from crates.io and won't be changed here (other than just pulling it again, later).

## Becoming a curator

You want to help curate the listing? Awesome. Just open a issue on github, giving some info about you and why you want to join.
