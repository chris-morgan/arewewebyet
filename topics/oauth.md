title: "OAuth Support"

intro: OAuth, the almost standard protocol of authentication on the web. Such an simple idea, but with so many varying implementations (twitter, facebook, whatever...) and tricky parts in the details, you really want to rely on having this done by a library for you. And while there is some stuff in rust, I wouldn't count on that being a solved problem...

level: 4
packages:
 - oauth2
 - oauth-client
