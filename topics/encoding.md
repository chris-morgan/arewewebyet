title: "En- & Decoding"

level: 1

intro: Encoding is one of those things you don't really want to bother about, but just rely on a well tested library for – there are just too many edge and quirky cases. Luckily, as a system language, this is one of the things rust shines at – and offers a set of nice packages already.

packages:
 - encoding
 - base64
 - urlencoded
 - multipart
 - http2parse
 - nue-io
 - hpack
