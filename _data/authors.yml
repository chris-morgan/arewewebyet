    Freelance OpenSource Software Architect and Developer


    I design, build and supervise the building of software (systems). Sometimes for clients, often times on my own, whenever possible as OpenSource. I care about good design in both, the User Experience and backend architecture and infrastructure. And I write about all this stuff.

    Iâ€™m a fourth year physics student studying at IIT Bombay. In my spare time I do a lot of programming, often open source, and participate in communities like Stack Exchange.

    These days I contribute to the [Servo browser engine](http://github.com/servo/servo) and occasionally to the [Rust programming language](http://github.com/rust-lang/rust)
