# Are we *web* yet?

**You can build stuff!**

<p>Rust has a mature <a href="/topics/stack/">HTTP stack</a>{% include level.html level=2%} and various <a href="/topics/frameworks/">frameworks</a>{% include level.html level=3 %} enable you to build APIs and backend services quickly. While increasingly more <a href="/topics/database/#drivers">databases drivers</a>{% include level.html level=2 %} become available, <a href="/topics/database/#orms">ORMs</a>{% include level.html level=5 %} and connections to <a href="/topics/services/">external services</a>{% include level.html level=5 %} (like search or worker queues) are still scarce. Looking farther, it doesn't necessarily get better. Though there is significant support for base needs (like <a href="/topics/compression/">data compression</a>{% include level.html level=2 %} or <a href="/topics/logging/">logging</a>{% include level.html level=2 %}), a lot more web-specific needs are still unmet and immature.</p>

## Can I replace my Rails/Django/Flask already?

**Well, probably not yet**. While the basics are there, many of handy utility libs that make working with many popular frameworks so quick and easy are still missing. **If your service primarily provides an API** to be consumed by  other computers, requires little external services and you are happy with writing most SQL yourself, then **Yes, You Can!** Otherwise, we would not recommend it just yet.

### What should I replace it with?

The frameworks of choice of the community are <a href="/topics/frameworks/#pkg-iron">iron</a>, <a href="/topics/frameworks/#pkg-conduit">conduit</a> and <a href="/topics/frameworks/#pkg-nickel">nickel</a>, best run with a <a href="/topics/database/#pkg-postgres">postgres</a> or <a href="/topics/database/#pkg-mysql">mysql</a> backend accompanied by <a href="/topics/database/#pkg-redis">redis</a> – all these drivers seem to be fairly mature. If you want to wrap that into an ORM <a href="/topics/database/#pkg-rustorm">rustorm</a> and <a href="/topics/frameworks/#pkg-diesel">diesel</a> are at your disposal – both are still fairly young though.

If you need to (or want to) go lower in the stack, those frameworks all use the fairly stable and mature <a href="/topics/stack/#pkg-hyper">hyper http stack</a>, if you want it slimmer <a href="/topics/stack/#pkg-tiny_http">tiny_http</a> might be an option and for the async-fans <a href="/topics/stack/#pkg-rotor-http">rotor</a> has you covered. If you need HTTP2, you have to turn to <a href="/topics/stack/#pkg-solicit">solicit</a> as none of the other stacks supports it just yet.
