Hi all,
This is update how treasure orm development progresses.
I have added small portion of querying api macros (well honestly just "select" for now with filtering api, other are not implemented but documented how they will be implemented).

Be aware that it's just "grammar". This query api should not change much in the future. Now I will start to work on query builder, which will this api will use.
You can find more info about querying here [github.com/phonkee/treasure#query](https://github.com/phonkee/treasure#query) Also I have updated more documentation with ideas and future plans.

Have a good day!
phonkee
