<p>Hey folks,</p>

<p>Today I'm releasing <a href="https://crates.io/crates/diesel" rel="nofollow">version 0.1 of Diesel</a>, a new ORM and Query Builder for Rust that I've been working on for the last few months. This isn't a port of Active Record or Hibernate, but is my take on what an ORM that "feels like Rust" looks like. I've been the maintainer of Active Record, which is the ORM for Ruby on Rails for some time, and I've taken a lot of the lessons from that experience and applied them here. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/sgrif/diesel#getting-started" rel="nofollow">getting started guide</a>, and feel free to ping me here or open an issue if you have any problems or questions. It is by no means feature complete, and there's still gaps in the API to fill, but I've really been enjoying using the core of this thing, and I'm excited to share it with you.</p>
