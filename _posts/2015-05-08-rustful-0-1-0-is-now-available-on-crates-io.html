<p>I'm proud to announce that I have finally brought Rustful, a small web framework, to a state where it deserves a proper version number and a place on <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/rustful\" rel=\"nofollow\">crates.io</a> <img src=\"https://cdn.discourse.org/business/images/emoji/emoji_one/tada.png?v=0\" title=\":tada:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\"tada\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">. I have also written <a href=\"http://ogeon.github.io/2015/05/08/rustful-0-1-0.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">an introduction</a> to what it's currently all about and a little about its past and what the future holds. Take a look at what it has so far, give it a try and tell me what you think. I would be happy to hear your feedback.</p>
