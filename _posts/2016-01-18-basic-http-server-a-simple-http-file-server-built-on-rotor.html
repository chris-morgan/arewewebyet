<p>While working on the docs I wanted to be able to serve them quickly, but didn't have a Rust-based tool for it, so I wrote <a href=\"https://github.com/brson/basic-http-server\">basic-http-server</a> as an excuse to play with <a href=\"https://medium.com/@paulcolomiets/async-io-in-rust-part-iii-cbfd10f17203\">rotor</a>. It serves static files out of the current directory over HTTP.</p>

<p>Here is it's <code>--help</code> output.</p>

<p></p><pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">USAGE:
   basic-http-server [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [ARGS]

  FLAGS:
   -h, --help Prints help information
   -V, --version Prints version information

  OPTIONS:
   -a, --addr &lt;ADDR&gt; Sets the IP:PORT combination (default "127.0.0.1:4000")

  ARGS:
   ROOT Sets the root dir (default ".")</code></pre>

  <p><a href=\"https://github.com/brson/basic-http-server/blob/master/src/main.rs\">The source is simple and thoroughly commented</a>.</p>

  <p>I've had difficulty measuring how fast it is. When I measure with <code>wrk</code> the results seem good, but with <code>ab</code> all requests timeout. I suspect that's a bug in rotor-http, but don't know.</p>
