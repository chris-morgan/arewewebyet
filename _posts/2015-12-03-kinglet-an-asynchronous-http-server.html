<p><a href=\"https://github.com/pyfisch/kinglet\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kinglet</a> is the beginning of a HTTP server based on mio. It manages connnections using state machines from <a href=\"https://github.com/tailhook/rotor\" rel=\"nofollow\">rotor</a> by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/users/tailhook\">@tailhook</a>. The most interesting part is the <a href=\"https://github.com/pyfisch/kinglet/blob/bb965b3bdddf5c2b84c04fd599575cdb0207efe8/src/http1.rs#L132-L222\" rel=\"nofollow\">request state machine</a>: with only a few lines of code it supports parsing requests with fixed size bodies, chunked bodies with optional trailers and even pipelining. Adding support for more states like <code>100-Expect-Continue</code> will be easy. Some parts of the code still need cleanup and the structures of requests and responses will change.</p>
