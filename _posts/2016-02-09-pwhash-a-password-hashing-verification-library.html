<p>Pwhash is a crate which lets you easily generate a hash from a password using several common algorithms, or check a password against an existing hash. You can get it from <a href="https://crates.io/crates/pwhash" rel="nofollow">crates.io</a>, or browse the <a href="https://github.com/inejge/pwhash" rel="nofollow">source repository</a>.</p>

<p>The initial release contains algorithms commonly found on free Unices. It shouldn't be difficult to extend if there's interest.</p>

<p>Comments/suggestions/criticism are welcome.</p>
