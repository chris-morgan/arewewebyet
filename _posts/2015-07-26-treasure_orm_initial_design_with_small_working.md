Hi,

I've been watching rust and its community for about a year, studied a lot about rust, and I have to say that I love rust. Time has come to try to build something real so I decided to start working on ORM for rust (yes ORM).

Since rust is statically compiled and there is no way to do "inspection" I went the way of syntax extensions (nightly), and started to generate code. I have just small part working, so please be kind.

If you are interested have a look at [github.com/phonkee/treasure](https://github.com/phonkee/treasure)

I would be really happy if you can comment it or want to help with building/designing Treasure ORM, so we can make a green badge on [arewewebyet.com](http://www.arewewebyet.org).

Thank you.
